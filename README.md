# ANN_CNN_Pytorch_Tutorial
This project demonstrates a PyTorch implementation of two neural network architectures—an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The notebook covers all the essential steps, including data loading and preprocessing, model definition, training loops, and evaluation on a test set.
